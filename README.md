## 1. Portfolio

This website is meant to serve as my portfolio. It consists of Navigation, About, Projects and Contact parts(plus separate pages for my other projects). 

It has some basic routing(using React Router Dom and React Router Hash-link) and most of the information is hard-coded. The only exception is the Project component, which has dynamically generated Card components inside it. 

The form in the Contact component is made with the help of EmailJS library, which allows it to work as client-side only. Additionaly, I implemented data validation to it.

The portfolio has responsive design.
